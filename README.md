# Interactive Resume

## Description

A interactive resume application that will seemlessly work between desktop and mobile, as well as, android, iOS, and windows machines.

## Purpose

Generally, whenever I learn a new language, I build my current resume within the context of the language. For example,
if I am trying to learn new concepts in c#, I will develop a local backend microservice, and the same applies to node. With dart,
the language is coupled to flutter, and flutter has some extensive documentation.

## Testing

Navigate to `https://dartpad.dev/`, once the page is loaded, open the main.dart file within this repo. Copy the entire contents, and 
paste what you just copied into the main.dart file of the dartpad sandbox. Now, you just need to click run.

## Board
